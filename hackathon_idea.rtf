and thoughtful
\f1\b0\fs24 \
\

\f0\b \ul Key Features:
\f1\b0 \ulnone \
1. Hardware Integration (maybe no need):\
+ Use the RFID module to scan items and\
the IR sensor to detect additions/removals (still confused)\
+ ESP32-S3 acts as a bridge between hardware\
and our mobile app (flutter) via Wi-fi\
\
2. Software Integration - Mobile App\
(flutter - very quick framework to develop IOS app - .dart programming language)\
+ Inventory management: View current stock/food/fruit and stuffs\
+ AI-driven recipe suggestions: Use an AI model/API\
for personalised recipes (should be AI to align with\
hackathon goal and some free hugging face transformer model - LLM model may \
be still okay, no need to purchase chatGPT API)\
+ IOS Notifications: Alert for low stocks or near-expiring items\
\
3. Presentation Slides (10 minutes):\
+ Background Information\
\

\f0\b \ul Features\ulnone :
\f1\b0 \

c) AI to help suggest recipes (Gemini AI or Free hugging face transformer model - no costly)\
d) Inventory Management - for people to view and easily manage (carbohydrate, sugar, calorie,\'85content)\
e) IOS Notifications: Alert for low stocks or near-expiring items (Suggestions for buying \
more stuffs, if you don\'92t get enough ingredients for the food, we need to buy)\
